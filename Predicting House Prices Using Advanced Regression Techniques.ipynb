    "**The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices based on a range of features provided in the dataset. This project, hosted on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview), involved applying advanced regression techniques to a dataset of house sale prices in Ames, Iowa. The challenge was to build a model that can accurately predict house prices based on both numeric and categorical features.**"
